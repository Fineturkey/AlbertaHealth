Family Bloom App (FFT Integration)

## Project Overview
This project aims to integrate FFT (Functional Family Therapy) principles into a user-friendly application, enhancing family communication, conflict resolution, and overall well-being. The app will include features for scheduling appointments, tracking progress, and providing personalized support based on FFT methodologies.

## Key Features
# Personalized Dashboard
Overview: Custom dashboards for each family member featuring tailored content, progress updates, and reminders related to their role in the FFT process.
- Journals: Family members can log mood entries and provide details on what happened(optional). Includes mood boards and quick descriptions (personal or shared).
- Task Management: Assign and track tasks with automatic adjustments using algorithms (e.g., when tasks are deferred).
- Family Activities: Suggest activities to enhance wellness and bonding, with options to vote and participate.
- Insightful Feedback: Family members can write their thoughts on the user, providing motivation and encouragement.
  # FFT Content
- Interactive Modules: Access to educational content about FFT principles, communication skills, and conflict resolution.
- Milestone Tracking: Visual representations of progress and milestones achieved.
- Book appointments and set reminders within the app.
# Simulation Features
- Conversation Scenarios: Virtual exercises to practice communication and problem-solving skills.
- Personal achievement boards: Track and recognize family participation and progress.
# AI Integration
- Feedback Mechanism: Systems to gather feedback from families and program participants for continuous improvement.
- Algorithms & AI: Advanced algorithms and AI to enhance user experience and provide personalized support for conversations.
# Future Developments
- Multicultural Support: Incorporate multicultural and linguistic features to accommodate diverse family backgrounds.
- Implement Security Features: Users can mark journal entries as public or private. Therapists can only access entries marked as public, ensuring private entries remain confidential.
- Regular Updates: Stay updated with the latest best practices and research in FFT and family therapy to maintain relevance and effectiveness.
- Iterative Development: Continuous improvement through iterative development and user feedback.
